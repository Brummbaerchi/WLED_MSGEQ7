This is my Fork of a Fork of WLED. (What?)<br>
WLED is neat. WLED-Audio reactive my Atuline is neat too.<br>
But i'm missing MSGEQE7 support so here i am coding it myself.<br>
At least i try to.<br><br>


## Current Pins: 
audio_reactive.h:

#define pinAnalog A0      //A0 on ESP8266<br>
#define pinReset 5        //GPIO5<br>
#define pinStrobe 4       //GPIO4<br>
<br><br>
feel free to change it for your needs.
<br><br><br><br>
THIS MAY NOT BE MAINTAINED!
